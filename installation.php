                <h1>Installation</h1>
                <p>elementary OS is designed to run on any relatively new 32-bit and 64-bit desktop or laptop. In this section, we'll cover system requirements and other prerequisites to installing elementary OS on your computer.</p>

                <h2>System Requirements</h2>

                <div class="column half">
                    <p>Minimum System Requirements:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>1 GHz 32-bit or 64-bit processor</li>
                        <li>512 MB of system memory (RAM)</li>
                        <li>5 GB of disk space</li>

                <h2>Downloading elementary OS</h2>
                <p>If you haven't already, you will need to <a href="index.php" target="_blank">download the elementary OS disk image from our home page</a>. This file is an ISO image — a snapshot of the contents of a bootable medium — which you will need to burn to a CD, DVD, or USB stick.</p>

                <h2>32-bit versus 64-bit</h2>
                <p>elementary OS is currently built for two processor architectures, 32-bit and 64-bit. If this sounds a bit technical for you, never fear:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>If you know you have a newer computer with a 64-bit processor, choose the 64-bit version.</li>
                    <li>If your computer is older or you do not know which type of processor your computer has, choose the 32-bit version. (64-bit processors will still be able to run this version).</li>
                </ul>

                        <h1>Back Up Your Data</h1>
                        <p>Make sure to back up all of your data to an external location such as a cloud service or an external hard drive. Installing a new operating system may overwrite your existing data.</p>

                <h1 id="creating-an-installation-medium">Creating an Installation Medium</h1>
                <p>To install elementary OS, you'll need some kind of installation medium. Either a blank CD or USB stick will work. Each option has its benefits and its drawbacks:</p>

                <ul>
                    <li>CDs are cheaply available and (unless your computer doesn't have a CD drive) your computer should support booting from a CD. If you're unsure which to use, a CD is a safe bet.</li>
                    <li>USB sticks are a lot faster and are reusable. However, if you have an older computer (2003 or older), your computer may not support booting from a USB. If your computer doesn't have a CD drive, chances are it supports booting from USB.</li>
                </ul>
