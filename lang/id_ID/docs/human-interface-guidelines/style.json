    "Icons should have a distinctive shape/silhouette to improve recognition. The shape should not be too complicated, but not every icon should be a rounded rectangle.": "Tiap ikon sebaiknya memiliki bentuk/siluet yang berbeda satu sama lain agar lebih mudah dikenali. Bentuknya jangan terlalu rumit, tetapi tidak harus selalu berbentuk segi empat tumpul.",
    "Outline": "Lis",
    "All elementary Icons, and shapes within the icons, are stroked with a thin outline to improve contrast. At low resolutions the stroke size is 1px. The stroke should <em>not</em> scale along with the icon, it should remain 1px.": "Semua ikon dengan bentuk-bentuknya diberi lis tipis untuk memperkuat kontras. Pada resolusi rendah ketebalannya adalah 1px. Lis tersebut <em>tidak boleh</em> mengikuti skala ikon, jadi ketebalannya harus tetap 1px.",
    "The color of the outline is a dark variant of the key color of the icon. This is done by creating a stroke at 30% opacity of black such that the border of the background lines up at half pixels. This is what allows icons with a stroke to appear sharp on dark backgrounds as well as light ones.": "The color of the outline is a dark variant of the key color of the icon.
